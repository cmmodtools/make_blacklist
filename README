make_blacklist.sh generates country netblocks in CIDR notation for use by pf
and nftables from data obtained directly from each Regional Internet Registry
(RIR).

The arguments are one or more ISO 3166 2-letter country codes. Files for pf
and nftables are produced containing netblocks allocated to or used by
organisations in those countries.

	make_blacklist.sh c1 c2 c3 ... cn

For country codes, refer to:

	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search

Known malicious networks, crawlers or other netblocks can be added to the
malnets.txt file so that those ranges are also included in the output files.

Netblock allocations change frequently and it may be useful to periodically
rerun the script to ensure accuracy. Note that approximately 22G of memory is
required by the process.

To use the results in pf, add the following line to pf.conf

	table <blacklist> persist counters file "/etc/pf.blacklist"

Similarly for nftables, add the below to nftables.conf

	include "/etc/nftables.blacklist_ipv4"
	include "/etc/nftables.blacklist_ipv6"

	table inet filter {
		set blacklist_ipv4 {
			type ipv4_addr; flags interval; counter;
			elements = $blacklist_ipv4
		}
		set blacklist_ipv6 {
			type ipv6_addr; flags interval; counter;
			elements = $blacklist_ipv6
		}
	...
	}
